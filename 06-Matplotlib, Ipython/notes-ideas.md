# Notes on Lecture 6 #

Slides for students who couldn't make it to the lecture.
General introduction to what we are trying to do would be good.
General introduction to matplotlib would be nice.
e.g. examples from website

plt.hold is not necessary

Q: Why have a space inside the parentheses of some function calls?

I think more background on the shortcomings would be good to show the students why you use it like that.

Parallel processing might be overkill for students.

Maybe split the whole lecture in matplotlib and ipython parts. I think the combination leads to confusion.

Maybe additionally split parallel processing into a third lecture in combination with e.g. cython and other performance oriented topics.

Ipython might be good to show in the context of different development environments/consoles.
