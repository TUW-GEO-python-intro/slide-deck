** Slides and code examples for the Course: 120.050 Introduction to Python programming for geoscience
The slides are done in [[http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/][reveal.js]] and were produced from the ~slides.org~ files in
each directory using emacs org-mode and [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][org-reveal]]. You can view them directly
on Github by clicking on the ~slides.org~ or the ~slides.pdf~ file in each class
folder, or download them for offline use.

Some lectures do not have explicit slides but are given out of a IPython
Notebook file. You can also view rendered versions of these ~*.ipynb~ files on
Github.
